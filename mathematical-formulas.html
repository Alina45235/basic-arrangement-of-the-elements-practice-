        <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
        
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
        <p class="formula">ax + b = 0</p>
        <p>where <span class="variable">a</span> and <span class="variable">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="variable">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="variable">x</span> so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span class="variable">x</span> there.</p>
        
        <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
        
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
        <p class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
        <p>where <span class="variable">a</span>, <span class="variable">b</span>, <span class="variable">c</span> are known values and <span class="variable">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="variable">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
        
        <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>
        
        <p>π (Pi) times the radius (<span class="variable">r</span>) squared:</p>
        <p class="formula">A = π × r<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="variable">D</span>):</p>
        <p class="formula">A = (π / 4) × D<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="variable">C</span>):</p>
        <p class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 × π</p>
        
        <h2>Intersection</h2>
        
        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="variable">A</span> and <span class="variable">B</span>, denoted by <span class="variable">A</span> ∩ <span class="variable">B</span>, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets <span class="variable">A</span> and <span class="variable">B</span>. In symbols,</p>
        <p class="formula">A ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B }</p>
        <p>That is, <span class="variable">x</span> is an element of the intersection <span class="variable">A</span> ∩ <span class="variable">B</span> if and only if <span class="variable">x</span> is both an element of <span class="variable">A</span> and an element of <span class="variable">B</span>.</p>
